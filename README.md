# IoT-Prototype--1
IoT prototype -1
Running Based Timing Gates - Analysis for 100 Mtrs Sprinters (Speedlightsystems - Jump mat systems) _ contact time

pain points- Unable to measure the Reaction Time

Test Module- Sprinters - Running

Output-

    Reaction Time
    Total time taken to cover the race

Input- Measurement Range - Milliseconds Distance and Time Velcoity and Acceleration and power by assuming instantaneous velocity, Average velocity

Accuracy- Sensitivity should be 0.01s - 10Millisecond

Sensors- Photo cells - EM Barriers IR sensors
